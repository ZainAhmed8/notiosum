# notiosum
The basis of notiosum is to stop yourself from becoming lazy. Everyone can admit that at some point, they were too lazy to get their stuff done. 
With notiosum, you can keep your tasks on track and make sure that you are progressing in anything that you choose. You will have an option to
create tasks and set them over different time intervals. Within each task, you will be able to create subtasks that need to be completed in order. 
Additionally, users can connect with their fellow friends and students to keep each other in check as a group. Using a system similar to having a 
mentor, you can have someone check on your tasks at least twice (once halfway through the deadline, and one very close to deadline). As a group, 
we can make sure that everyone stays on top of their busy schedules and succeeds!
